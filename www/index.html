			<p>He was Rector of the church in Haworth from 1742 until his death in 1763. 
			He was an evangelist and was even known to leave the church whilst psalms were sung to search the churchyard, 
			street and even the alehouses to round up the sinners.</p>
			<p>In one long sermon, he said "I may talk to you till my tongue is as small as a sparble. 
			You will all go to hell after all" (a sparble was a small nail used in clog making).</p>

			because of problems with the balloon, it was postponed until the evening of Monday 11th and took place on 
			West Lane football field.</p>
			<p>This time there were no problems and the balloon ascended to about 700ft and Lily jumped and her parachute opened normally. 
			She descended to about 100ft and then was observed to wriggle from the parachute harness and plummet to the 
			ground where she was severely injured and was taken back to her room at the Old White Horse, where she was pronounced dead.</p>
			<p>At the inquest, a verdict of 'death by misadventure' was reached, but it was speculated that Lily, realising that 
			she was drifting towards the nearby Ponden reservoir and as she couldn't swim, she deliberately freed herself from 
			the parachute misjudging her current height from the ground.</p>
